Httpstone is a simple tool to create stress test sequences for HTTP servers.

Small Java classes (Workers) can be written to implement various testing cycles. The tool runs many such workers simultaneously, showing their status (working, waiting, error) in real-time on a colored grid.

To get started, see the README file at the top of the source code tree.
